## About The Project

This project is a traffic sign recognition system that can identify and classify traffic signs from images. The system uses machine learning algorithms to detect and recognize traffic signs, and it can be used in various applications such as autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in future.

## Getting Started
To get started with the traffic sign recognition system, follow these steps:

### Installation


1. Clone the repository :
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MKv18/Traffic- 
   Signs-Recognition.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages : 
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the traffic sign recognition script :
   ```sh
   python traffic_sign_recognition.py
   ```
## Usage

This projectvcan be used in various applications such as autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)


## Roadmap
The traffic sign recognition system requires the following packages
-  Python 3.x
-  OpenCV
-  TensorFlow
-  Keras
-  Numpy
