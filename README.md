# Traffic Sign Recognition

This project is a traffic sign recognition system that can identify and classify traffic signs from images. The system uses machine learning algorithms to detect and recognize traffic signs, and it can be used in various applications such as autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in future.

## About the project

This project is a real-time traffic sign recognition system built using Python, OpenCV, and a pre-trained CNN model, capable of detecting and recognizing traffic signs from both video streams and images.

The project includes a Jupyter notebook with the following:

1. Data exploration and preprocessing
2. Model training and evaluation
3. Model deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository :
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MKv18/Traffic- 
   Signs-Recognition.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages : 
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the traffic sign recognition script :
